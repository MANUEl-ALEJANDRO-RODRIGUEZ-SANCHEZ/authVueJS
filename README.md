# 🚀 Vue.js 3 + Firebase 9 Authentication Project 🔥

This project implements a user authentication system using **Vue.js 3** and **Firebase 9**. Users can register, log in, log out, and access protected routes, all managed through Firebase Authentication. Welcome to a modern, functional, and secure web application! 💻🌐

## 🛠 Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create an account with their email and password.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Easily log in with Firebase Auth.
- **Route Protection**: Sensitive routes are protected, accessible only to authenticated users.
- **Logout**: Users can log out at any time, securing their account.
- **Modular Components**: Clear and scalable structure with Vue.js 3.
- **Integrated Modal**: Registration and login are handled through modal forms, providing a modern user experience.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### Login and Registration

1. When you visit the home page, you will see the **Login** form. If you don't have an account, you can switch to the **Registration** form.
2. After successfully logging in, the form will disappear and you will see a welcome message: \`"Welcome! Logged in"\`.

### Navigation between routes

- **Home**: Public route accessible to everyone.
- **About & Contact**: Protected routes that only authenticated users can visit.

### Log Out

- From the navigation menu, you can easily log out, which will revoke your access to the protected routes.

## 🚧 Project Status

The project is constantly evolving. Some future improvements include:
- 🔒 Google/Facebook authentication.
- 💬 Implementation of a chat system.
- 📱 Responsive design.
